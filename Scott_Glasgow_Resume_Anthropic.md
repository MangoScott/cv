## AI Safety Motivation

I've spent a decade building technology to improve financial health for millions—and witnessed firsthand how systems can either empower or harm vulnerable populations. My work with Google Health on COVID-19 open data, reaching 190+ countries, showed me both the transformative power of well-deployed technology and the critical importance of getting it right. I'm drawn to Anthropic's mission because I believe the same rigor I've applied to financial wellbeing research must be applied to ensuring advanced AI systems remain beneficial, interpretable, and aligned with human values. I want to contribute to building AI that helps rather than harms.

## Why Anthropic Fellows Program

I bring a unique combination:
1. **Empirical research experience** — Published in Nature and peer-reviewed journals; 5+ active working papers with PhD collaborators
2. **Technical fluency** — Python, data pipelines, API development, AI-assisted coding
3. **Systems thinking** — Built and scaled technology serving 1M+ users; understand how AI deployment affects real populations
4. **AI integration expertise** — Extensive hands-on experience with LLMs for research and development
5. **Mission alignment** — A decade of building technology for societal benefit; deeply motivated by ensuring AI helps rather than harms

I'm excited to apply this background to empirical AI safety research, particularly in areas like **Scalable Oversight** (my experience with large-scale data systems) and **AI Welfare** (understanding how AI interacts with human wellbeing).
